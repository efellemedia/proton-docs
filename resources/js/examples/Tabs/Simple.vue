            <p class="text-2xl font-bold">In the morning after the storm, Dr. Nancy Stevens sends a drone into the air.</p>
            <p class="text-xl">"This the worst part,” she says, as she shows me the carnage in the viewfinder. “You could believe it?”</p>
            <p>The hillside of St. Thomas is naked. All of the trees have been stripped of their leaves, revealing the upturned soil beneath. Tucked between trees are bits of debris and trash, some from storms past, and in a small clearing, an old church is completely gutted, its front side torn clean off. The sea off of Waterfront is still angry, all white froth and brown with runoff.</p>

        <p-tab name="Two">
            <p>The drone passes over a flooded street near the Windward Passage Hotel, not too far from the Charlotte Amalie Harbor. Already, people are outside along the flooded street, walking around, assessing the damage.</p>
            <p>Stevens’ phone rings, and she answers. “Talk fast,” she says.</p>
            <p>“People are clearing debris along Theodore Boschulte Drive,” Common says. “Could use some hands.”</p>
            <p>“On the way,” Stevens tells the AI.</p>
            <p>I can’t help but notice how casual Stevens’ tone is, like she is talking to another person. But I understand the intimacy. Common is a precious resource here, a significant component of their commonwealth, a lifesaver.</p>
            <p>The strong AI doesn’t respond again, just hangs up. I hand Dr. Stevens the viewfinder, and she calls the drone down. “Better get to it,” she says, “if we want to be done by lunchtime.”</p>

            <p>Common, the open-sourced artificial intelligence based on the principle of accessible knowledge. The strong AI gets its name from “the commons,” a concept of public ownership of resources for the collective good. Common is governed by a federation of collective institutions from all over the world that are devoted to the mission of AI as a public resource. Anyone can add knowledge to Common, and there is a democratic process to building the hardware necessary to carry the AI. Common is decentralized and spread across all of the devices that run its software. Tech cooperatives create vessels to hold the AI — from literal black boxes to giant robots — but most people use practical vessels like smartphones and watches.</p>
